/* Title :  Require initial inspection to be statused (InspectionScheduleBefore)

Purpose :  If an inspection of a particular type that contains the string “Final” is being scheduled then check all the existing inspections
on the record and make sure there is an inspection that has a string from the same inspection type that is NOT a final and
has a result of “Passed”. For Example: If the user is trying to schedule an inspection type called “Electrical Final Inspection”
there must be an inspection such as “Electrical Rough Inspection” on the record in a passed status. If there is not an
inspection of similar type on the record in a passing status then prevent the user from scheduling the Final inspection and
display an error message to the user saying “$$Initial Inspection Type$$ is not Passed”.
